## About Omnifood

**Omnifood** is a fictional brand brought to life by **Jonas Schmedtmann** in his course, *Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS*. This project has been a fantastic opportunity for me to build a landing page that not only highlights this imaginary brand but also helped me level up my frontend web development skills. 🚀

This project was the most comprehensive in the course, allowing me to dive deep into several important topics, such as:

- 🎨 The design process and how to effectively plan each step
- 📄 Structuring different sections of the page, like the header, hero section, and footer
- 📱 Making everything responsive using media queries, so it looks great on any device

### Project Highlights

The Omnifood website features a full redesign of the original site, which is an AI-based meal subscription service. Here are some cool features I implemented:

- **Sticky Navigation**: The navigation bar sticks to the top of the page, making it super easy to get around. 🧭
- **Hamburger Menu**: A sleek mobile-friendly menu that expands with a click, perfect for smaller screens. 🍔
- **Toggle Switch**: An interactive element that adds to the user experience. 🔄
- **Animations**: Fun CSS animations triggered by the IntersectionObserver API, making the site feel dynamic and lively. 🎉
- **Smooth Scrolling**: A fluid experience as users navigate between sections of the page. 🌀

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts beautifully to different devices, ensuring it looks amazing on desktops, tablets, and phones alike. 📲
- **Interactive Elements**: From hover effects to engaging animations, the site is designed to keep users interested and involved. 🎈
- **Sleek Styling**: I carefully chose the layout, color scheme, and typography to create a modern and appetizing look. 🎨

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Conclusion

Creating the Omnifood website has been an exciting journey! 🎊 It not only allowed me to put into practice what I learned in the course but also provided me with valuable hands-on experience in web development. I’m thrilled to share this project and can’t wait to take on more challenges in the frontend world! 💪
